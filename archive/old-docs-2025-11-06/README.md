# Archived Documentation (2025-11-06)

This folder contains the original planning documentation created before the comprehensive documentation overhaul.

## What's Here

These documents were created during initial project setup but were replaced with a more comprehensive documentation suite.

## Current Documentation

For current, up-to-date documentation, see the `/docs` folder in the repository root.

**Start here:** [/docs/START_HERE.md](../../docs/START_HERE.md)

## Why Archived?

These docs are preserved for historical reference but should not be used for current development. The new documentation suite includes:

- Complete project specification
- Detailed 6-milestone roadmap
- GitHub Copilot integration guides
- Git workflow strategy
- Progress tracking system
- Learning resources with spaced repetition
